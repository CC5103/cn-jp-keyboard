## 📢 Introduction

Typing Chinese (Pinyin) on a Japanese keyboard often leads to mismatched or inconvenient punctuation behavior.  
This project solves the issue by remapping punctuation keys so they output proper Chinese punctuation when using a JP keyboard layout.

In addition, a macOS-like **Kana key** is provided, allowing instant switching to Japanese input mode. This significantly improves the experience for users who frequently alternate between Chinese and Japanese.

## 🚀 Features

- **Punctuation Remapping**  
  Ensures Chinese-style punctuation when typing Chinese on a Japanese keyboard layout.

- **Kana Key Functionality**  
  Provides a dedicated macOS-style Kana key to toggle Japanese input with a single keystroke.

## 🖥️ Supported Systems

Tested on **Windows 11**.  
Expected to work on other Windows versions that use the same IME system, registry paths, and keyboard layout infrastructure.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**  
   Get the script files from this repository.

   > **If you have not installed the Japanese IME**:  
   > - Go to **Settings → Time & Language → Language & Region**  
   > - Click **Add a language**  
   > - Search for **Japanese**, then install

2. **Use Only Punctuation Remapping**  
   - Run **`Keyboard_CN_to_JP\Change_Keyboard_CN_to_JP.reg`**  
     to modify the registry and enable punctuation remapping.

3. **Use Only the Kana Key Feature**  
   - Run **`Kana_to_jp\install_ahk_and_startup.bat`**  
     to install AutoHotkey and set up the Kana script to run at startup.
   > - Recommended Setting (Optional):  
   >   Set the **無変換** key as a one-touch English toggle:
   >   - Open **Settings → Time & Language → Language & Region → Japanese → Options → Microsoft IME → Keyboard and Touch Customization** → Key Assignment  
   >   - Set **無変換** to **IME off**

4. <span style="color:red">**Apply Changes**</span>  
   - Restart your computer.

##　🛠️ How to Restore

1. **Restore Punctuation Remapping**  
   - Run **`Keyboard_CN_to_JP\Restore_Keyboard_CN.reg`**  
     to revert the registry to its default state.

2. **Remove the Kana Key Feature**
    - Run **`Kana_to_jp\Restore_kana_to_jp.bat`  
      to remove the Kana script from startup.
    - Uninstall AutoHotkey if no longer needed.

3. <span style="color:red">**Apply Changes**</span>
   - Restart your computer.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If, after running **`Keyboard_CN_to_JP\Change_Keyboard_CN_to_JP.reg`**, you notice **extra input method options** in your input method list, please follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the "Run" dialog, type `regedit`, and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.

2. Navigate to the following path:

   ```plaintext
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Preload
   ```

   Delete any extra input method entries (usually only keep `"1"` and `"2"`, delete the rest).
  
3. Next, check the following path:

   ```plaintext
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Substitutes
    ```
  
    Ensure that **only**
  
    ```plaintext
    "00000804"="00000411"
    ```
    exists. If there are other entries, please delete them.

4. Finally, delete the settings cache at the following path:
    ```plaintext
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\International\User Profile\zh-Hans-CH
    ```
After completing the above steps, **restart your computer**, and the issue should be resolved.
